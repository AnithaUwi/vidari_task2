## About This Project

I built a clean, modern transaction dashboard for Vidaripay that helps users easily track their financial activities. The design focuses on clarity and ease of use while maintaining the Vidaripay brand identity.

## Why I Chose This Design

### Card-Based Layout Over Tables
I went with cards instead of a traditional table because:
- **Easier to read** on mobile phones
- **Better visual separation** between transactions
- **Feels more modern** like today's banking apps
- **More engaging** with subtle hover effects

###  Mobile-First Thinking
The dashboard works beautifully on all devices - from phones to desktops. The sidebar gracefully hides on smaller screens to maximize space for the important transaction data.

###  Key Features That Matter
- **Smart Filtering**: Quick status filters (All, Success, Failed, Pending)
- **Live Stats**: See your total transactions, current balance, and latest activity 
- **Clean Loading**: Friendly skeleton screens instead of boring spinners
- **Status Colors**: Green for success, orange for pending, red for failed 

## Technical Simplicity
- **React + Vite**: Fast and modern
- **Tailwind CSS**: Clean, consistent styling
- **Simple State Management**: No over-engineering just what's needed
